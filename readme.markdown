This is still under development. If you want League Manager, I recommend using the official version via Wordpress. However, I hope to have this up and about by April 2011.

What's all this about
============

There is no question this is a cool plugin, and there is nothing really like it out there.

However I really need it for my main sporting passions: American Football (Gridiron, NFL) and Australian Rules Football (Aussie Rules, AFL).

Am looking to modify this to support both codes, support their season formats and finals/playoffs with a focus on for and against, teams with enhanced listings, dynamic calendars and more.

Anyone who is keen to see it go in this direction would love some help.

Additions so far
============

- For and against points now work based upon existing scores
- Add locations / grounds / arenas with geocoding and club/team relationship
- Add rounds / weeks to matches so matches can be grouped via a schedule

Still to do
============

- Ensure rankings take into account for and against (percentage/ratio)
- Social media tools (FB integration with events)
- iCal and Google Calendar download for each match
- Output widgets with greater flexibility
- Heaps more
