=== What's all this about ===

There is no question this is a cool plugin, and there is nothing really like it out there.

However I really need it for my main sporting passions: American Football (Gridiron, NFL) and Australian Rules Football (Aussie Rules, AFL).

Am looking to modify this to support both codes, support their season formats and finals/playoffs with a focus on for and against, teams with enhanced listings, dynamic calendars and more.

Anyone who is keen to see it go in this direction would love some help.

All credits and thanks go to one person, the original creator and inspiration: Kolja Schleich
